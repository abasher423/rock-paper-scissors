# rock-paper-scissors

I created a simple implementation of the grade-school classic **rock paper scissors** which is being hosted [here](https://abasher423.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)
Although this was a simple task i have learnt many things from this project such as:
- DOM Event Delegation
- Switch statements
- Randomly selecting things out of an object
