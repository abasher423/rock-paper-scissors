# rock-paper-scissors

I created a simple implementation of the grade-school classic **rock paper scissors** which is being hosted [here](https://abasher423.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

Rules:
- First one to **5** wins

I have learnt many things from this project such as:

- DOM Event Delegation and event listeners
- Switch statements
- Randomly selecting things out of an object and arrays
- Adding audio for sound effects in JS
