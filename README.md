# rock-paper-scissors

I created a simple implementation of the grade-school classic **rock paper scissors** which is being hosted [here](https://abasher423.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)
I have learnt many things about the Document Object Model(DOM) from this project and other things such as:

- DOM Event Delegation
- Switch statements
- Randomly selecting things out of an object and arrays
- Adding audio for sound effects in JS
